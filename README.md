<h1 align="center">PLC PROGRAMMING TIA PORTAL EXAMPLES</h1>

**We share examples to show how PLC elements are programmed through the Tia Portal program of Siemens. 
The operation of the diagrams was observed with PLCSim program. As a device, I performed the simulations on the S7-1200.
In the coming days, I will also include ladder diagrams and working logic on the readme and medium page in each project folder. 
I would like to share the text-based programming method (STL) of PLC elements and how the operation of the units can be 
observed with three-dimensional simulations such as factory io. 
Stay tuned ðŸ‘‹**
