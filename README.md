# Electrical and Push Button Interlock Ladder Diagrams and Tag Tables
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this section, I shared with you the ladder diagrams for different basic projects over 
the Siemens S7-1200 model PLC via the Tia Portal program. 
I aimed to teach you the block and tag tables used in PLC programming and the logic of input and output. 
I would like to share factory simulations and more advanced projects with FactoryIO in the future.
sincerely :)
